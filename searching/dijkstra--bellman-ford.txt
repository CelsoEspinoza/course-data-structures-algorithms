- Dijktra and Bellman-Ford are two algorithms that finds the SHORTEST PATH(similar to BFS,
    but it takes the edge weigth into consideration. 
    The arrows are the edges.


// (0)----20---->(1)----6---->(3)
//    \
//     15---->(2)----3---->(4)


- Bellman-Ford is better to find the shortest path since it can acommodate negative weigths.
    Takes long time to run in terms of complexity. Worst case => O(n^2)

- Dijktra is a little bit faster and efficienty. It can't accomodate negative weigths.
